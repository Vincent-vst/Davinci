# Notes  

## REST  

rest -> Representational State Transfer 
REST = architecture 
3 types of request -> Get (to retrieve info), Post (to add stuff), Delete (to delete)

## TODO   
Handle errors for the API (404, 400, 500)
> should be easy with : 
<!-- except : 
    abort (404, "url does not exist") -->
